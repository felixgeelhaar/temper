## What We're NOT Building (v1)

- ❌ Autonomous coding agent
- ❌ Speed/volume optimization
- ❌ Cloud-hosted sandboxes
- ❌ Ticketing system integration (Jira, GitHub Issues)
- ❌ Gamification (streaks, points, leaderboards)

---

## Current Focus

**Priority for v1 completion:**

1. ~~**Spec-driven workflow**~~ ✅ — Specular format with validation, locking, drift detection
2. ~~**Intent inference**~~ ✅ — Auto-detect Training/Greenfield/Feature from context
3. ~~**Neovim plugin**~~ ✅ — Full feature parity with VS Code extension
4. ~~**Evidence-based appreciation**~~ ✅ — Progress recognition without gamification

**v1 Core Features Complete!**

## Philosophy

> This product is not about doing work faster.
> It is about protecting and scaling human judgment in the age of AI.
> That is a rare, meaningful, and defensible mission.
