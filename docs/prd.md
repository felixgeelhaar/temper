Product Requirements Document
Product: Temper
(Outcome-driven, strategy-first — not a feature list)
⸻

1. Executive Summary
   This product provides adaptive AI pairing for learning complex crafts.
   It enables users to:
   • Practice deliberately
   • Receive calibrated feedback
   • Retain authorship and intent
   • Grow from novice to expert without losing autonomy
   ⸻
2. Problem Definition
   Primary problem
   AI tools optimize for completion, not comprehension.
   Secondary problems
   • Learners don’t know what to practice next
   • Feedback is binary or generic
   • Over-assistance creates fragile competence
   Explicit anti-goals
   • We do not optimize for speed
   • We do not default to generation
   • We do not remove cognitive effort
   ⸻
3. Personas & Jobs-To-Be-Done
   Developer (Beginner → Staff+)
   • “Help me build correct mental models.”
   • “Help me reason in new paradigms.”
   Product Manager
   • “Help me think in outcomes, not features.”
   • “Challenge my assumptions.”
   Interview Candidate
   • “Help me practice under constraints without cheating.”
   Organization (Later)
   • “Help people grow skills we can trust.”
   ⸻
4. Product Principles (Non-Negotiable)
5. AI restraint is a feature
6. Understanding beats speed
7. The user is always the author
8. Intervention is adaptive, not user-toggled
9. Progression is earned
   ⸻
10. Core Capabilities (Domain-Agnostic)
    Adaptive Intervention Engine
    Determines the minimum helpful action:
    • Question
    • Hint
    • Conceptual nudge
    • Structural critique
    • Direct explanation (only when appropriate)
    Learning Profile
    Tracks:
    • Skill level
    • Confidence
    • Dependency
    • Blind spots
    • Growth trajectory
    Craft Workspace
    A controlled environment to:
    • Create artifacts (code, PRDs, narratives, strategies)
    • Iterate
    • Reflect
    Pairing Modes (Dynamic)
    • Teach → Pair → Review
    Modes shift automatically based on behavior.
    Learning Journey Orchestration
    • Suggests what to practice next
    • Adapts difficulty and autonomy
    • Detects plateaus and over-reliance
    ⸻
11. Success Metrics (Outcome-Based)
    • Self-reported understanding
    • Reduction in AI dependency
    • Ability to solve novel problems
    • Retention through increasing difficulty
    • Evidence of transfer learning
    ⸻
12. Risks & Open Questions
    • Frustration vs growth balance
    • Trust calibration
    • Over-restriction vs under-guidance
    • Transition from sandbox to real environments
    These are learning risks, not technical risks.
    ⸻
13. Business Model (Exploratory)
    • B2C: Premium subscription (craft mastery)
    • B2B (later): Onboarding, upskilling, interview prep
    • Expansion via depth, not volume
