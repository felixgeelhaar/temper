## Implementation Status

✅ = Complete | 🔨 = In Progress | ⏳ = Planned

⸻
1. Executive Summary
   This product provides adaptive AI pairing for learning complex crafts.
   It enables users to:
   • Practice deliberately
   • Receive calibrated feedback
   • Retain authorship and intent
   • Grow from novice to expert without losing autonomy
   ⸻
2. Problem Definition
   Primary problem
   AI tools optimize for completion, not comprehension.
   Secondary problems
   • Learners don't know what to practice next
   • Feedback is binary or generic
   • Over-assistance creates fragile competence
   Explicit anti-goals
   • We do not optimize for speed
   • We do not default to generation
   • We do not remove cognitive effort
   ⸻
3. Personas & Jobs-To-Be-Done
   Developer (Beginner → Staff+)
   • "Help me build correct mental models."
   • "Help me reason in new paradigms."
   Product Manager
   • "Help me think in outcomes, not features."
   • "Challenge my assumptions."
   Interview Candidate
   • "Help me practice under constraints without cheating."
   Organization (Later)
   • "Help people grow skills we can trust."
   ⸻
4. Product Principles (Non-Negotiable)
5. AI restraint is a feature
6. Understanding beats speed
7. The user is always the author
8. Intervention is adaptive, not user-toggled
9. Progression is earned
   ⸻
10. Core Capabilities (Domain-Agnostic)

    Adaptive Intervention Engine ✅
    Determines the minimum helpful action:
    • Question (L0)
    • Hint (L1)
    • Conceptual nudge (L2)
    • Structural critique (L3)
    • Direct explanation (L4-L5, gated)

    Learning Profile ✅
    Tracks:
    • ✅ Skill level (per topic)
    • ✅ Dependency (hint reliance)
    • ✅ Blind spots (error patterns)
    • ✅ Growth trajectory (trend over time)
    • 🔨 Confidence (self-assessment)

    Craft Workspace ✅
    A controlled environment to:
    • ✅ Create artifacts (code workspaces)
    • ✅ Iterate (run checks, get feedback)
    • ⏳ Reflect (session retrospectives)

    Pairing Modes (Dynamic) 🔨
    • Teach → Pair → Review
    • ✅ Intent buttons (user-selected)
    • ⏳ Modes shift automatically based on behavior

    Learning Journey Orchestration ⏳
    • ⏳ Suggests what to practice next
    • ⏳ Adapts difficulty and autonomy
    • ⏳ Detects plateaus and over-reliance

    Exercise System ✅
    • ✅ 41 exercises across 3 language packs
    • ✅ Go Fundamentals (14 exercises)
    • ✅ Python Fundamentals (13 exercises)
    • ✅ TypeScript Fundamentals (14 exercises)
    • ✅ Structured rubrics and check recipes
    • ✅ Progressive hints (L0-L3)
    ⸻
11. Success Metrics (Outcome-Based)
    • Self-reported understanding
    • ✅ Reduction in AI dependency (hint dependency tracking)
    • Ability to solve novel problems
    • Retention through increasing difficulty
    • Evidence of transfer learning
    ⸻
12. Risks & Open Questions
    • Frustration vs growth balance
    • Trust calibration
    • Over-restriction vs under-guidance
    • Transition from sandbox to real environments
    These are learning risks, not technical risks.
    ⸻
13. Business Model (Exploratory)
    • B2C: Premium subscription (craft mastery)
    • B2B (later): Onboarding, upskilling, interview prep
    • Expansion via depth, not volume
