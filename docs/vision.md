Product Vision Document
Product: Temper — Adaptive AI Pair for Craft Learning
⸻

1. The Problem (From First Principles)
   High-quality work in knowledge domains is learned through practice, feedback, and judgment.
   Yet modern tools force a damaging tradeoff:
   • Traditional learning (docs, courses, templates)
   → slow feedback, poor context, shallow transfer
   • Generative AI (copilots, agents, one-shot generators)
   → fast output, but collapses the learning loop by doing the work for you
   As a result:
   • Learners finish tasks without understanding
   • Professionals lose deliberate practice
   • Organizations gain speed but lose long-term capability
   The industry is optimizing for output while silently eroding craft.
   ⸻
2. The Vision
   We envision a world where AI:
   • Protects learning instead of bypassing it
   • Adapts its role dynamically as people grow
   • Helps humans become better thinkers, not passive reviewers
   • Preserves authorship, intent, and judgment
   Vision Statement
   An adaptive AI pair that helps people master complex crafts by thinking with them — not instead of them.

3. What We Mean by “Craft”
   A craft is a domain where:
   • There is no single correct answer
   • Judgment and tradeoffs matter
   • Quality emerges through iteration
   • Experience compounds over time
   Examples:
   • Software engineering
   • Product management
   • System design
   • Sales strategy
   • Marketing narrative
   • Business & technical writing
   This product is not designed for:
   • One-shot generation
   • Simple Q&A
   • Task automation

4. Who This Is For
   Primary (Entry Wedge)
   • Developers learning new languages, paradigms, or design principles
   • Engineers who want depth, not shortcuts
   • Interview candidates who want integrity in preparation
   Secondary (Expansion)
   • Product managers learning discovery, PRDs, vision
   • Founders refining strategy and narrative
   • Sales & marketing professionals developing judgment
   Tertiary (Organizational)
   • Teams onboarding new hires
   • Organizations investing in durable skill growth
   ⸻
5. The Learning Contract (Core Belief)
   This product enforces a learning contract:
   • When the user has no mental model → AI may lead
   • When the user is learning → AI must pair
   • When the user is capable → AI must step back
   • The human remains the author at all times
   This contract is system-enforced, not optional.

6. North Star Outcome
   “I understand why this works — and can apply it elsewhere.”
   Long-term impact:
   • Reduced dependency on AI
   • Stronger judgment
   • Transferable skill, not memorization
   ⸻
7. Why We Win
   Incumbents are structurally constrained:
   • Productivity tools must optimize for speed
   • Content platforms optimize for completion
   • Generators optimize for plausibility
   None can withhold help by design.
   Our differentiation is:
   • Behavioral
   • Philosophical
   • Systemic
   Which makes it hard to copy without breaking existing products.
